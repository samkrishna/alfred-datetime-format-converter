alfred-datetime-format-converter
================================

This is an Alfred 5 workflow for converting between timestamps and formatted datetime strings with ease. 

## Why?

I've always loved this plugin and I was surprised that it broke when Apple *finally* removed Python 2. This is also an exercise in upgrading a Python 2 codebase to modern Python 3 as well as going from Alfred 2 to Alfred 5.

## NOTE

This a "hard-forked" repo (meaning no legacy commit history) of Michael Waterfall's Alfred 2 Datetime Format Converter workflow. You can view that original repo [here](https://github.com/mwaterfall/alfred-datetime-format-converter). 

I'm doing this BECAUSE I'd like to be able to open and close issues without worrying about whether or not the original developer is returning to Github, since it looks like his GitHub activity has gone dormant.

## How to Use

Simply type "df" followed by: "now", a UTC unix timestamp, or a formatted datetime string.

This will present you with the parsed date in various formats ready to copy to your clipboard.
